## Instructions
Run using `python3 analysis.py <path to csv>`

## Requirements
Python 3.12 was used, although 3.11 should also work. Please include the latest version
of all packages in the requirements.txt.

## Note on approach
I chose to implement an EOQ model as they are really useful for products with
finite shelf lifes and large lead times to ordering.

## Time spent
Overall about 2 hours were spent, most of which was spent preparing these documents.
